# ROQALS (ROutines for Quasar Absorption Line Surveys)
The respository contains python routines for determining absorption line and galaxy properties relevant for any absorption line study. The codes were originally written for Far-UV spectra obtained from the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph onboard the Hubble Space Telescope, and galaxy spectroscopic data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, but it should be possible to customize them for other datasets well.
